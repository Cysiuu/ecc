### Pull Requests
To contribute code, please:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or fix.
3. Ensure your code adheres to the [coding standards](#coding-standards).
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

**PR Checklist:**
- [ ] The code compiles without errors.
- [ ] All tests pass.
- [ ] Documentation (comments and/or markdown files) is updated.
- [ ] Lint checks have been run.

## Coding Standards

### Formatting
- Use **camelCase** for variable and function names.
- Use **PascalCase** for class names.
- Maintain consistent **indentation**

### Frontend (Vue + Vuetify)
- Ensure all Vue components are **modular and reusable**.
- Place **styles scoped** within components.
- Use **Vuetify** classes and components for consistent design.

### Backend (Java + Spring Boot)
- Follow **Java naming conventions** for packages, classes, methods, and variables.
- Use **RESTful principles** for API design (i.e., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Document code where necessary.

## Branching Strategy

To keep the codebase clean and organized, use the following branching strategy:
1. **main** - Always reflects production-ready code.
2. **develop** - Holds the latest changes, including in-progress features.
